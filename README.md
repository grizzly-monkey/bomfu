BOMfu is a collaborative writing tool for bill of materials (BOM).

Bomfu is a collaborative bill of materials (BOMs) web repository with open hardware projects in mind.
The success of open hardware rests on peoples’ ability to reproduce published designs and this depends 
highly on the ease of use and quality of the BOM. However until now there has been no comprehensive 
repository for open source hardware and so, Bomfu was born.
Sourcing all the constituent parts is the first hurdle in building an open design. 
Bomfu is the best way to collaborate with others on open hardware, allowing developers total 
ownership of their BOMS and projects.

Bomfu is about distribution, flexibility and openness. 
Creating open source hardware is a hugely creative endeavor. 
Hardware development and its community must be asynchronous, which is just 
another way of saying building globally not just locally. This means in order for 
an open hardware project to be successful it must be geographically distributed, 
attention aware, team oriented and have minimal overhead in its process. 
Bomfu makes this possible regardless of complexity. We want pull request 
to become discussions that improve project quality, this isn’t just about 
creating BOMs but its about creating a community controlled project repository 
which helps people build locally or globally in the most effective way possible.  


BOMfu is made possible thanks to Mozilla Foundation and Eyebeam Art and Technology Center in NYC.
